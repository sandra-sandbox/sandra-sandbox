# **Welcome to sandra-sandbox!**

Hello, everyone! I am Sandra who is currently passionate in delving the opportunities lying in the data field deeper.
I am a highly curious person who likes to learn something new.
That's why, I think I want to give a try on working personal data science projects to gain more familiarity with the tools as well as ideas in the future.

So, please freely have a look on my works and I am open for your feedbacks as well!

Love,

Sandra (٥ ˘з˘)~
