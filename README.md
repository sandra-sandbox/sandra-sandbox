# **Welcome to sandra-sandbox!**

Hi everyone! 
I'm Sandra an Industrial Engineer, and I'm excited about diving deeper into the world of data. 
As a curious learner, I'm eager to expand my knowledge and skills. 
To achieve this, I'm taking on personal data science projects to gain hands-on experience with industry tools and develop innovative ideas.


So, please freely have a look on my works and I am open for your feedbacks as well!

Love,

Sandra (٥ ˘з˘)~
